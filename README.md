A quick repo to demonstrating use of
[nbsphinx](https://github.com/spatialaudio/nbsphinx) and
[RTD](https://nbsphinx-rtd-test.readthedocs.io/).


This was previously used to illustrate a
[failure-case](https://github.com/spatialaudio/nbsphinx/issues/64),
but as of Feb 2017 everything seems to be working nicely with the default setup,
so this just serves as a minimum-working-example for nbsphinx.
